    <h3>Right way with python and ruby!</h3>
	
    <p>This is my first post in English to practice this skill that is so important. I intend to publish others post in english as well.<br />
       Attention Unix fan boys , this post is for you!!!</p>

    <p>Sometime ago, I read this message by <a href="http://twitter.com/fnando">@fnando</a> in twitter!</p>

    <ul>
      <li>“Na próxima vez que alguém disser que trabalhar com ruby/rails no windows, vou dar um abraço. você é um herói!”</li>
      <li>“Next time that someone says that works with ruby/rails on windows, I will give him a hug. you are a hero!”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I loved to read this sentence, and I would like to give my opinion about it!</p>

    <p><strong>Why Right way with python and ruby?</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Ruby comes by default in Mac Os</li>
      <li>Python comes by default in many distros GNU Linux</li>
      <li>Ruby and Python are languages that UNix community adopts as development platform.</li>
      <li>test runner is so slow</li>
    </ul>

    <p>this is a sign that unix platform is the most prepared!</p>

    <p><strong>So, you should not use in Windows?</strong></p>

    <p>Thats not the point. Yes you can use ruby and python in Windows, both are multi-platform. But you need to understand that you are going to have some problems!</p>

    <p>Examples:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Some gem and pip have dependency with libs of operation system.</li>
      <li>Slow support compared with Unix platform.</li>
      <li>RVM, that is the main used sandbox, don’t have Windows support.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Anyway, my suggestion is to use Windows only to develop simple projects (little gems,pip), that I believe you will not face any problems. For more complex projects, use Unix!</p>

    <p>Now everybody knows why I like these programming languages very much!!!!</p>
