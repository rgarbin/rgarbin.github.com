<p>Today my friend and co-worker <a href="http://mauricioklein.com/">Mauricio Klein</a> left our company to find new challenges and oportunities, This is a bad day for me because he's an amazing person that love to be developer and resolve hard problems, a simple full stack developer always prepared to resolve any thing, never choosing job or fixing issue to delivery fast, forgeting quality.</p>

<p>Yes, It's natural this moment, unfortunately,  but I would like to wish him all the best in this new way. Thank you so much for helping us contributing with many of our projects, always playing for team. Great times are comming with many others challenges, have fun because you can. </p>

<p>I'm really happy to have worked with you, I hope you have many oportunities to make difference like here.</p>

<p>Let's Rock guy \o/</p>
